		<h2>Yaroa</h2>
			<p>Yaroa is a popular Dominican street food that’s both savory and filling. It’s typically made by layering French fries or fried plantains as the base, then topping them with seasoned meats such as shredded chicken, ground beef, or pork. Over the meat, generous amounts of cheese are melted, and it’s all finished with drizzles of ketchup, mayonnaise, and sometimes mustard. The dish is known for its rich, comforting flavors and is often enjoyed late at night, making it a favorite comfort food in the Dominican Republic</p>
